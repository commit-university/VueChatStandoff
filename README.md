You must:

- Build your app with snippets in bullets.txt
- Run your app and fix it!
- Enter the #Saloon room
- Use your Passphrase as fast as possible to shoot any message in the #Saloon room, gain access to the band of #ElPasoBank and some points!
- Enter the #ElPasoBank using your new band name
- Shoot any message in the #ElPasoBank and gain points!

Remember:

In #Saloon room: you can use *rank to see your current team points.
